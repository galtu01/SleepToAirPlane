# SleepToAirPlane
Automatically turn on Airplane mode when Windows goes to sleep and turn it off when it wakes up. This solves some Modern Standby issues.

## install
Just run the exe. A console window will appear and it will start monitoring sleep.
The "h" option hides the console window. In this case, it can only be ended via Task Manager.
By creating a shortcut to "SleepToAirPlane.exe h" and placing it in "shell:startup", it will run automatically without displaying the window when your PC starts up.

### TODO
- Tasktray icon
- Startup Installer
